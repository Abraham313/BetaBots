				<p>The BetaBots game is a preseason competition allowing teams to experience 
				all the aspects of a FIRST Robotics Competition event on a small scale.

				<p>A simple game is announced in early October, with competitions beginning 
				at the end of November.  The game uses a small field and has one robot competing 
				against one robot.  The game is simple enough for beginner teams to excel, but 
				uses the subtleties of a full scale FIRST Robotics Competition game for experienced 
				teams to benefit as well.</p>

				<p>An autonomous period is used in the BetaBots game, followed by teleoperated play.  
				The game is designed such that it can be accomplished using a single mechanism, 
				allowing beginners to learn without being overwhelmed.  Judges are present at BetaBots 
				competitions, and interact with teams in their pits.  Furthermore, teams are required 
				to give a private presentation to judges, requiring teams to prepare for the judges 
				on any aspect they wish relating to the team or the robot.  Awards are given at the 
				end of the competition for the winning team, as well as for creativity, innovation 
				in control, quality and the judgesâ€™ award.</p>

				<p>A BetaBots competition takes place over the course of a single day, and can be 
				played in a high school gym.  Capacity is generally limited to 10 teams, allowing 
				teams to play as many matches as possible while still exposing them to other teams 
				and robot designs.  Registration fees are very modest, and teams can register for 
				multiple events depending on availability.</p>

				<p>BetaBots is a small scale robotics program designed as an introduction 
				to the FIRST Robotics Competition.  It was created from the ground up to 
				expose participants to as many aspects of robotics as possible.  It is not 
				meant to replace FIRST robotics, rather to exist alongside it, giving 
				participants a good taste of the program.  BetaBots is particularly useful 
				for rookie teams as well as new team members, giving them an idea of what 
				to expect during a robotics season.  It is also useful for veteran teams, 
				allowing them to give senior students leadership positions and gain valuable 
				experience on key decision making.</p>
				<p>The FIRST robotics program is very involved.  It introduces participants 
				to many aspects of robotics through a sport-like competition.  The FIRST 
				Robotics Competition season begins each year in January, and includes a 
				short but intense build period followed by a competition season.  Training 
				participants as soon as possible is essential to the success of a team.  
				The BetaBots program is designed to prepare participants for the FIRST 
				Robotics Competition without overwhelming them.</p>
