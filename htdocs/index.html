			<p>BetaBots is a small scale robotics program designed as an introduction 
			to the FIRST Robotics Competition.  It was created from the ground up to 
			expose participants to as many aspects of robotics as possible.  It is not 
			meant to replace FIRST robotics, rather to exist alongside it, giving 
			participants a good taste of the program.  BetaBots is particularly useful 
			for rookie teams as well as new team members, giving them an idea of what 
			to expect during a robotics season.  It is also useful for veteran teams, 
			allowing them to give senior students leadership positions and gain valuable 
			experience on key decision making.</p>
			<p>The FIRST robotics program is very involved.  It introduces participants 
			to many aspects of robotics through a sport-like competition.  The FIRST 
			Robotics Competition season begins each year in January, and includes a 
			short but intense build period followed by a competition season.  Training 
			participants as soon as possible is essential to the success of a team.  
			The BetaBots program is designed to prepare participants for the FIRST 
			Robotics Competition without overwhelming them.</p>
